# ipython-notebooks

Some IPython Notebooks.
Use this link to view them with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mjuenema/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/).

## Notes to myself:

Local Git clone is at `/Documentation/Development/Languages/Python/Notebooks`.

Run Jupyter as

```
workon jupyter	# workon jupyter3
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888
```
